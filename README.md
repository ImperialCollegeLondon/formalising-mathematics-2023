# Formalising Mathematics

> [!WARNING]  
> This course was in Lean 3 which is now out of date (end of life). The [2024 version of this course](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2024) is in Lean 4.

This is the repository for Kevin Buzzard's 2023 course on formalising mathematics in the Lean theorem prover. The course ran from January to March 2023. 

## Local installation

If you have Lean 3 and the community tools installed in your computer, then it's just a matter of typing

```
leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2023
```

into the command line. Instructions for installing Lean 3 and the relevant tools are [here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install).

## Online play

Whilst installing Lean and this project locally is the recommended way to do this course, if you have an account at Github you can [play online using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics-2023) (wait a minute or two for everything to download and set up). Briefly: when everything's finished downloading, open up the `src` directory on the left and then you should see the relevant files.

## Course notes

The course notes are [here](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2023/). They are a work in progress, and will grow in parallel with this repo over the period Jan to March 2023.
