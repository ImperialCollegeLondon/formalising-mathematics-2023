# Factorization of ideals into primes

The correct generality to set up a theory of factorization of nonzero ideals into prime
ideals is to assume that the ground ring is a Dedekind domain.

open_locale number_field -- for ùìû K notation

-- Lean knows that the integers of a number field are a Dedekind domain

example (K : Type) [field K] [number_field K] : is_dedekind_domain (ùìû K) := infer_instance

-- here's how to say "let R be a Dedekind domain"

variables (R : Type) [comm_ring R] [is_domain R] [is_dedekind_domain R]

open is_dedekind_domain

There's an entire directory of files `ring_theory.dedekind_domain` containing
results about Dedekind domains. There are still a few "TODO"s though; for
example `ring_theory.dedekind_domain.dvr` contains a definition which is
known to be equivalent to Dedekind domain, but this is not yet proved in mathlib.

## Nonzero prime ideals of a Dedekind domain.

Here's the definition of `is_dedekind_domain.height_one_spectrum`:

```
structure height_one_spectrum :=
(as_ideal : ideal R)
(is_prime : as_ideal.is_prime)
(ne_bot : as_ideal ‚â† ‚ä•)
```

It's the nonzero prime ideals of `R`. Because Dedekind domains are either fields or
1-dimensional, `height_one_spectrum R` is either empty (if `R` is a field) or
the set of maximal ideals of `R`.

A key result is that in any Dedekind domain, any nonzero ideal is contained
in only finitely many maximal ideals.

example {I : ideal R} (hI : I ‚â† 0) :
  {v : height_one_spectrum R | v.as_ideal ‚à£ I}.finite := 
begin
  exact ideal.finite_factors hI,
end

-- Hence it makes sense to take a product over these factors. 
-- The theorem `ideal.finprod_height_one_spectrum_factorization`
-- says that every nonzero ideal factors into primes.

example (I : ideal R) (hI : I ‚â† 0) :
  ‚àè·∂† (v : height_one_spectrum R), v.max_pow_dividing I = I :=
begin
  exact ideal.finprod_height_one_spectrum_factorization I hI,
end

-- Furthermore the factorization is unique
example : unique_factorization_monoid (ideal R) := infer_instance
