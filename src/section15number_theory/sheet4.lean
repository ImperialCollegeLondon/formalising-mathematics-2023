# Prove that for all positive integers n we have that 
# 169 | 3^{3n+3}-26n-27

This is the fourth question in Sierpinski's book "250 elementary problems
in number theory".

Proof: note that n=0 also works :-) In general use induction on n.

Base case n=0 works fine.

Inductive step: we assume `169 ∣ 3^{3d+3}-26d-27`
So it divides 27 times this
which is `3^{3(d+1)+3}-26*27*d-27*27`
and we want it to divide `3^{3(d+1)+3}-26(d+1)-27`

so we're done if it divides the difference, which is
`-26d-26-27+26*27d+27*27`
which is `26*26n+26*26 = 13*13*something`

-- The statement has subtraction in, so we use integers.
example (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) : -- remark; not going to use hn
(169 : ℤ) ∣ 3^(3*n+3)-26*n-27 := 
begin
  clear hn, -- told you
  sorry,
end
