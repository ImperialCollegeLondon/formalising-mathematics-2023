# Prove that 19 ∣ 2^(2^(6k+2)) + 3 for k = 0,1,2,... 


This is the fifth question in Sierpinski's book "250 elementary problems
in number theory".

thoughts

if a(k)=2^(2^(6k+2))
then a(k+1)=2^(2^6*2^(6k+2))=a(k)^64

Note that 16^64 is 16 mod 19 according to a brute force calculation
and so all of the a(k) are 16 mod 19 and we're done

  sorry,
