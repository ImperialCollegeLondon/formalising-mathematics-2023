Note that `X ≃ Y` is not an equivalence relation, for the stupid
reason that it's not even a true-false statement! It doesn't
say "there exists a bijection from X to Y" (which would be an
equivalence relation), it is the *type* of bijections between
`X` and `Y`, and in particular it can have more than one term
(indeed we just saw two distinct terms of type `ℚ ≃ ℚ` on the
previous sheet). However we can make some equivalence-relation-y
type constructions with `≃`. Here are definitions (not theorems!)
called `equiv.refl`, `equiv.symm` and `equiv.trans`.

-/

-- this is called `equiv.refl` in `mathlib`
example (X : Type) : X ≃ X :=
{ to_fun := λ x, x, -- x ↦ x 
  inv_fun := λ y, y,-- y ↦ y
  left_inv := begin
    -- got to check that `∀ x, inv_fun (to_fun x) = x`
    intro x,
    dsimp, -- if you want to check the goal is definitionally `x = x`
    refl,
  end,
  right_inv := begin
    -- goal is definitionally `∀ y, to_fun (inv_fun y) = y`. 
    intro y,
    refl,
  end }

-- now let's see you define `equiv.symm` and `equiv.trans`.
-- Let's start with `equiv.symm`.
-- Note that if `e : X ≃ Y` then `e.to_fun : X → Y`
-- and `e.left_inv` is a proof of `∀ x : X, e.inv_fun (e.to_fun x) = x` etc

-- This is `equiv.symm`. Can you fill in the proofs?
example (X Y : Type) (e : X ≃ Y) : Y ≃ X :=
{ to_fun := e.inv_fun, -- you could write `λ x, e.inv_fun x` instead
  inv_fun := e.to_fun, -- this is data -- don't use tactic mode
  left_inv := begin
    exact e.right_inv,
  end,
  right_inv := begin
    exact e.left_inv,
  end }

-- Actually, you're not supposed to write `e.to_fun` and `e.inv_fun`
-- directly, because `X ≃ Y` has got a coercion to `X → Y`,
-- so you can (and should) do it like this:

-- `equiv.symm` again
example (X Y : Type) (e : X ≃ Y) : Y ≃ X :=
{ to_fun := e.symm, -- using `equiv.symm` and dot notation
  inv_fun := e, -- using the coercion to function
  left_inv := e.right_inv,
  right_inv := e.left_inv, }

-- `equiv.trans`
example (X Y Z : Type) (eXY : X ≃ Y) (eYZ : Y ≃ Z) : X ≃ Z :=
{ to_fun := λ x, eYZ (eXY x), 
  inv_fun := λ z, eXY.symm (eYZ.symm z), 
  left_inv := begin
    intro x,
    simp,
  end,
  right_inv := begin
    intro z,
    simp,
  end }

-- Because `equiv.trans` is already there, we can just use it
-- directly:
example (X Y Z : Type) (eXY : X ≃ Y) (eYZ : Y ≃ Z) : X ≃ Z :=
equiv.trans eXY eYZ

-- here it is again using dot notation
example (X Y Z : Type) (eXY : X ≃ Y) (eYZ : Y ≃ Z) : X ≃ Z :=
eXY.trans eYZ

-- See if you can make the following bijection using dot notation
example (A B C X : Type) (eAX : A ≃ X) (eBX : B ≃ X) : A ≃ B :=
eAX.trans eBX.symm

/-

Note that `equiv` is *data* -- `X ≃ Y` doesn't say "`X` bijects with `Y`";
that statement is a true-false statement. A term of type `X ≃ Y`
is *explicit functions* `X → Y` and `Y → X`, together with proofs
that they're inverse bijections.

Clearly there's an equivalence relation going on *somewhere* though:
here it is.  

If `X : Type` then `∃ x : X, true` is just the statement that `X`
is nonempty. It's a proposition. So this works:

-/

-- Two types `X` and `Y` satisfy `R X Y` iff there *exists*
-- a bijection `X ≃ Y`. 
def R (X Y : Type) : Prop := ∃ e : X ≃ Y, true

example : equivalence R :=
begin
  refine ⟨_, _, _⟩,
  { intro X,
    exact ⟨equiv.refl X, trivial⟩, },
  { rintro X Y ⟨eXY, _⟩, 
    exact ⟨eXY.symm, trivial⟩ },
  { rintro X Y Z ⟨eXY, _⟩ ⟨eYZ, _⟩,
    exact ⟨eXY.trans eYZ, trivial⟩ },
end

-- Remark: the equivalence classes of `R` are called *cardinals*.
