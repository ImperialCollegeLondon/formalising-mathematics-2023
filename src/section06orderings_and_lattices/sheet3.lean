# A harder question about lattices

I learnt this fact when preparing sheet 2.

With sets we have `A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)`, and `A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)`.
In sheet 2 we saw an explicit example (the lattice of subspaces of a 2-d vector space)
of a lattice where neither `A ⊓ (B ⊔ C) = (A ⊔ B) ⊓ (A ⊔ C)` nor `A ⊓ (B ⊔ C) = (A ⊓ B) ⊔ (A ⊓ C)`
held. But it turns out that in a general lattice, one equality holds if and only if the
other one does! This was quite surprising to me.

The challenge is to prove it in Lean. My strategy would be to prove it on paper first
and then formalise the proof. If you're not in to puzzles like this, then feel free to skip
this question.

example (L : Type) [lattice L] : 
  (∀ a b c : L, a ⊔ (b ⊓ c) = (a ⊔ b) ⊓ (a ⊔ c)) ↔ (∀ a b c : L, a ⊓ (b ⊔ c) = (a ⊓ b) ⊔ (a ⊓ c)) :=

end
