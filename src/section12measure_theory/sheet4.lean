# Measures

Recall that Lean calls a space equipped with
a sigma algebra a "measurable_space". We will go with this language
and call sets in the sigma algebra "measurable sets".

Given a measurable space, a *measure* on the measurable space is a function from
the measurable sets to `[0,‚àû]` which is countably additive (i.e.,
the measure of a countable disjoint union of measurable sets is the sum of the measures).
This is not the *definition* of a measure in Lean, but it is mathematically equivalent to the
definition. 

For what it's worth, the actual definition of a measure in Lean is this: an `outer_measure`
on a type `Œ±` is this:

```
structure outer_measure (Œ± : Type*) :=
(measure_of : set Œ± ‚Üí ‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû)
(empty : measure_of ‚àÖ = 0)
(mono : ‚àÄ{s‚ÇÅ s‚ÇÇ}, s‚ÇÅ ‚äÜ s‚ÇÇ ‚Üí measure_of s‚ÇÅ ‚â§ measure_of s‚ÇÇ)
(Union_nat : ‚àÄ(s:‚Ñï ‚Üí set Œ±), measure_of (‚ãÉi, s i) ‚â§ ‚àë'i, measure_of (s i))
```

So it attaches an element of `[0,‚àû]` to *every* subset of Œ±, satisfying some natural axioms;
note in particular it is countably *sub*additive, meaning that the measure of a countable
union of open sets, even if they're pairwise disjoint, is only assumed to be at most the sum of the measures.

And if `Œ±` has a measurable space structure then a measure on `Œ±` is an outer measure satisfying
some axioms, which boil down to "the restriction of the outer measure is a measure on the measurable
sets, and the extension of this measure to an outer measure agrees with the outer measure we started with".
The advantage of doing it this way is that given a measure, we can evaluate it on *any* subset
(getting the outer measure of the subset) rather than having to supply a proof that the subset
is measurable. This coincides with Lean's "make functions total" philosophy (the same reason that 1/0=0).

Try proving the following:

example (S T : set Œ©) (hS : Œº S ‚â† ‚àû) (hT : measurable_set T) : 
  Œº (S ‚à™ T) = Œº S + Œº T - Œº (S ‚à© T) :=
begin
  sorry,
end

/-
*Remark*: while proving the above, you might have noticed I've added the 
condition `hS` (think about what is a + ‚àû - ‚àû). In particular, subtraction in 
extended non-negative reals (`‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû`) might not be what you expect, 
e.g. 1 - 2 = 0 in `‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû`. For this reason, the above lemma is better phrased as 
`Œº (S ‚à™ T) + Œº (S ‚à© T) = Œº S + Œº T` for which we can omit the condition `hS`.

## Measurable functions

So far we've worked in the space `Œ©` though with all mathematical objects, we 
want to map between them. In measure theory, the correct notion of maps is 
measurable functions. If you have seen continuity in topology, they are quite 
similar, namely, a function `f` between two measurable spaces is said to be 
measurable if the preimages of all measurable sets along `f` is measurable.

If you go to the definition of measurable you will find what you expect. 
However, of course, measure theory in Lean is a bit more complicated. As we 
shall see, in contrast to maths, there are 3 additional notions of measurability 
in mathlib. These are: 
- `ae_measurable`
- `strongly_measurable`
- `ae_strongly_measurable`
The reasons for their existence is technical but TLDR: `ae_foo f` is the predicate 
that `f` is almost everywhere equal to some function satisfying `foo` (see the 
a.e. filter section) while `strongly_measurable f` is saying `f` is the limit 
of a sequence of simple functions.

Alongside `measurable`, we also see them quite often in the mathlib, although 
all you have to know is in most cases (range is metrizable and second-countable), 
`measurable` and `strongly_measurable` are equivalent.

  (f : X ‚Üí Y) (g : Y ‚Üí Z) (hg : measurable g) (hf : measurable f) :
  measurable (g ‚àò f) :=
begin
  sorry,
end

## Integration

One of the primary motivations of measure theory is to introduce a more 
satisfactory theory of integration. If you recall the definition of the 
Darboux-Riemann integral, we cannot integrate the indicator function of 
`‚Ñö ‚à© [0, 1]` despite, intuitively, the set of rationals in the unit interval 
is much "smaller" (rationals is countable while the irrationals are not. 
In contrast, measure theory allows us to construct the Lebesgue integral 
which can deal with integrals such as this one. 

Lean uses a even more general notion of integration known as Bochner integration 
which allows us to integrate Banach-space valued functions. Its construction 
is similar to the Lebesgue integral. 

Read page 5-6 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07636.pdf
if you want to know the details.

-- Suppose now `X` is another measurable space

-- and suppose it's also a Banach space (i.e. a vector space and a complete metric space)
variables [normed_add_comm_group X] [normed_space ‚Ñù X] [complete_space X]

-- If `f : Œ© ‚Üí X` is a function, then the integral of `f` is written as 
-- `‚à´ x, f x ‚àÇŒº`. If you want to integrate over the set `s : set Œ©` then write 
-- `‚à´ x in s, f x ‚àÇŒº`.

-- Try looking in mathlib
example {f g : Œ© ‚Üí X} (hf : integrable f Œº) (hg : integrable g Œº) :

  (hŒº : 0 < Œº {œâ | 0 < f œâ}) : 
  (0 : ‚Ñù) < ‚à´ œâ in {œâ | 0 < f œâ}, f œâ ‚àÇŒº :=
begin
  sorry
end

/-
*Remark* It's a common myth that Lebesgue integration is strictly better than 
the Darboux-Riemann integral. This is true for integration on bounded intervals 
though it is not true when considering improper integrals. A common example 
for this is, while `‚à´ x in [0, ‚àû), sin x / x dx` is Darboux-Riemann integrable 
(in fact it equals `œÄ / 2`) it is not Lebesgue integrable as 
`‚à´ x in [0, ‚àû), |sin x / x| dx = ‚àû`.

## ae filter

Now we have come to a very important section of working with measure theory 
in Lean.

In measure theory we have a notion known as almost everywhere (a.e.). In 
probability this is known as almost surely however we will stick with 
almost everywhere in this project. Namely, a predicate `P` on `Œ©` is said to 
be true almost everywhere if the set for which `P` holds is co-null, i.e. 
`Œº {œâ : Œ© | P œâ}·∂ú = 0`. 

As examples, we say:
- given functions `f, g`, `f` equals `g` a.e. if `Œº {œâ : Œ© | f œâ ‚â† g œâ} = 0`;
- `f` is less equal to `g` a.e. if `Œº {œâ : Œ© | ¬¨ f œâ ‚â§ g œâ} = 0` etc.

Often, showing that a property holds a.e. is the best we can do in 
measure/probability theory. 

In Lean, the notion of a.e. is handled by the `measure.ae` filter.
Let's construct that filter ourselves.
-/

example (X : Type) [measurable_space X] (Œº : measure X) : filter X :=
{ sets := {U | Œº U·∂ú = 0},
  univ_sets := begin
    sorry,
  end,
  sets_of_superset := begin
    sorry,
  end,
  inter_sets := begin
    sorry,
  end }


-- say `f` and `g` are measurable functions `Œ© ‚Üí X`
variables (f g : Œ© ‚Üí X)
-- The following is a proposition that `f` and `g` are almost everywhere equal
-- it's **not** a proof that `f` and `g` are a.e. equal but simply a statement
example : Prop := ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, f œâ = g œâ

-- Here's another example on how to state `f` is almost everywhere less equal 
-- than `g`
-- To be able to formulate this we need a notion of inequality on `X` so we 
-- will add the `has_le` instance on `X`, i.e. equip `X` with a inequality 
example [has_le X] : Prop := ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, f œâ ‚â§ g œâ

-- Since the above two cases come up quite often, there are special notations 
-- for them. See if you can guess what they mean
example : Prop := f =·µê[Œº] g 
example [has_le X] : Prop := f ‚â§·µê[Œº] g

-- In general, if `P : Œ© ‚Üí Prop` is a predicate on `Œ©`, we write `‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, P œâ` 
-- for the statement that `P` holds a.e.
example (P : Œ© ‚Üí Prop) : Prop := ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, P œâ

-- Sanity check: the above notation actually means what we think
example (P : Œ© ‚Üí Prop) : (‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, P œâ) ‚Üî Œº {œâ | P œâ}·∂ú = 0 := 
begin
  refl,
end

-- Heres a more convoluted example. See if you can figure what it means
example (f : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (s : set Œ©) := 
  ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº.restrict s, ‚àÉ l : ‚Ñù, tendsto (Œª n, f n œâ) at_top (ùìù l)

-- Now to do some exercises: you will need to dig into the source code to see 
-- what the definitions are and search for helpful lemmas
-- *Hint*: try out the `measurability` tactic. It should be able to solve simple 
-- goals of the form `measurable_set s` and `measurable f`
example (s : set Œ©) (f g : Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù)
  (hf : measurable f) (hg : measurable g) (hfg : ‚àÄ œâ ‚àà s, f œâ = g œâ) : 
  f =·µê[Œº.restrict s] g :=
begin
  sorry,
end

example (f g h : Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (h‚ÇÅ : f ‚â§·µê[Œº] g) (h‚ÇÇ : f ‚â§·µê[Œº] h) : 
  2 * f ‚â§·µê[Œº] g + h :=
begin
  sorry,
end

example (f g : Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (h : f =·µê[Œº] g) (hg : ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, 2 * g œâ + 1 ‚â§ 0) :
  ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, f œâ ‚â§ -1/2 :=
begin
  sorry,
end

example (f g : ‚Ñï ‚Üí Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (a b : ‚Ñù) 
  (hf : ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, tendsto (Œª n, f n œâ) at_top (ùìù a))
  (hg : ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, tendsto (Œª n, g n œâ) at_top (ùìù b)) :
  ‚àÄ·µê œâ ‚àÇŒº, tendsto (Œª n, f n œâ + g n œâ) at_top (ùìù (a + b)) :=
begin
  sorry,

I hope that you found the above examples slightly annoying, especially the 
third example: why can't we just `rw h`?! Of course, while we often do do so on 
paper, rigourously, such a rewrite require some logic. Luckily, what we normally 
do on paper is most often ok and we would like to do so in Lean as well. While 
we can't directly rewrite almost everywhere equalities, we have the next best 
thing: the `filter_upwards` tactic. See the tactic documentation here: 
https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#filter_upwards

The `filter_upwards` tactic is much more powerful than simply rewritting a.e. 
equalities and is helpful in many situtations, e.g. the above second, third 
and fourth examples are all easily solvable with this tactic. Let us see how 
it works in action.
-/

-- Hover over each line and see how the goal changes
example (f‚ÇÅ f‚ÇÇ g‚ÇÅ g‚ÇÇ : Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (h‚ÇÅ : f‚ÇÅ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÅ) (h‚ÇÇ : f‚ÇÇ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÇ) : 
  f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÅ + g‚ÇÇ :=
begin
  filter_upwards [h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ],
  intros œâ hœâ‚ÇÅ hœâ‚ÇÇ,
  exact add_le_add hœâ‚ÇÅ hœâ‚ÇÇ,
end

-- Heres an even shorter proof using additional parameters of `filter_upwards`
example (f‚ÇÅ f‚ÇÇ g‚ÇÅ g‚ÇÇ : Œ© ‚Üí ‚Ñù) (h‚ÇÅ : f‚ÇÅ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÅ) (h‚ÇÇ : f‚ÇÇ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÇ) : 
  f‚ÇÅ + f‚ÇÇ ‚â§·µê[Œº] g‚ÇÅ + g‚ÇÇ :=
begin
  filter_upwards[h‚ÇÅ, h‚ÇÇ] with œâ hœâ‚ÇÅ hœâ‚ÇÇ using add_le_add hœâ‚ÇÅ hœâ‚ÇÇ,
end

/-
Intuitively, what `filter_upwards` is doing is simply exploiting the fact that 
the intersection of two full measure sets (i.e. complements are null) is also 
a set of full measure. Thus, it suffices to work in their intersection instead. 

Now, try the above examples again using the `filter_upwards` tactic.
